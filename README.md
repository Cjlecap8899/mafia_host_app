✅ Features
🎮 Game Modes

You can start a game with different player counts:

10 players (standard mode)
Classic setup with full role distribution.

9 players (special mode)
Roles: Sheriff, 6 Citizens, 2 Mafia, Don
⚠️ The app still creates 10 players, but Player #10 is always a Citizen.
(Many hosts remove this player early depending on house rules.)

8 players
Roles: 1 Mafia, Don, Sheriff, 5 Citizens

🃏 Role Assignment (Host stays blind)

Roles are distributed using a card-pick system

Each player reveals their role only on their turn

The host can continue the game without learning any roles

☀️ Day Phase (Game Panel)

Track alive players

Add/remove fouls:

Tap → add foul

Double tap → remove foul

🌙 Night Phase

Players act one by one:

Citizens solve a math task

Don shoots + checks who is Sheriff

Mafia shoots

At the end of the night the app calculates the night result and returns to day phase.

🌍 Multi-language Support
